  alpha = 0.05,

\arguments{
\item{model}{A formula specifying the model..}

\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing the variables used in the model.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level used for the hypothesis tests; defaults to 0.05.}

\item{variables}{Optional; a character vector of predictor names to test.
If NULL, all predictors in the model are tested.}

\item{betaNull}{Optional; a numeric vector of null hypothesis values for the coefficients.
Must be the same length as \code{variables} if not NULL.}

\item{nBlocks}{The number of blocks to use for permutations.}

\item{nPerms}{Optional; the number of permutations to perform.
If NULL or greater than the number of possible permutations, all permutations are used.}

\item{studentize}{Logical indicating whether to use studentized residuals for the test.}

\item{permutation}{Optional; a specific permutation vector to rearrange order of data.}

\item{randomizationDist}{Logical indicating whether to return randomization distribution for each null hypothesis value.}

\item{optimize}{Logical indicating whether to optimize the ordering of the data.}

\item{GX1}{Logical indicating whether to use GX1 or X1 when constructing eps_hat.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{GA::ga()} for optimizing power.
This can include parameters like \code{popSize}, \code{maxiter}, \code{parallel}, etc.,
that are used to configure the genetic algorithm. Note that when sample size is large
optimizing is computationally expensive and has little effect.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'et', which includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: A matrix summarizing the test results for each variable.
\item \code{detailed}: A list containing detailed test results for each variable.
\item \code{gaResults}: Optional; a list of results from the \code{GA::ga()} function, included only when
power optimization is performed via genetic algorithm parameters. Each element of the list
corresponds to results for one of the tested variables, containing details like the best
permutations found, fitness scores, and other GA diagnostics.
\item \code{call}: The matched call.
}
}
\description{
Performs exact tests on specified coefficients of a linear model object
using permutation tests to generate p-values and confidence intervals around
the estimated coefficients. This function can handle both studentized and
non-studentized test statistics, and allows the user to specify various
parameters for the test.
}
\details{
The function divides the data into blocks specified by \code{nBlocks} and performs permutations
within these blocks to generate the null distribution of the test statistic. The user can
specify a set number of permutations with \code{nPerms}, or allow the function to calculate all
possible permutations if \code{nPerms} is unspecified or too large.

If \code{studentize} is TRUE, studentized residuals are used to adjust the test statistics,
potentially leading to more robust inference under model misspecification.

The function allows for a high degree of customization through its parameters and can
handle large datasets and complex model structures efficiently.
